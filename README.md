## Technical Notes 

The cave data is first scraped from http://registry.gsg.org.uk/sr/browse.php using scrape_data.py. The name of the cave, tags associated with the cave type, length of the cave, vertical range and altitude of the caves are scraped from the main table. The link for each record is also obtained so that the user can refer back to the original source. The scraped data is stored in a dataframe and saved to a csv file as this is a common data format. 

The csv data is then converted to XML, so it can be used to create a database. A XML constructor was created using CaveXML as defined by Norbert Sch√∂rghofer (https://github.com/nschorgh). This constructor is used to convert the scraped data from a csv to an XML format.
