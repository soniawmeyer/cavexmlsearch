Roberts 1937). 

Despite this description above, a small hole at the right hand side of the second of the two obvious chambers leads through a tightish squeeze into a sometimes flooding stream chamber. Beyond this stream either through one of three low wet crawls (only passable in extremely dry weather) or a dry crawl near the top of the rubble slope to the right leads to one of the largest cave systems in Assynt. 

Cave of Roaring.-1939. Mr. W. Fairbank in the second chamber broke a way through into a considerable cavern with a burn which must be above the Cave of Water. Rigg had previously been down the great slab in the latter.

Inchnadamf. - 1947.  Mr. A. L. Butcher and a Sheffield University party explored ... the Cnoc nam Uamh caves, of Water and Roaring, they worked upstream and found the series ends in a huge pool in a chamber at least 200 ft. long.

1952. -  Marshall and Stoney ... visited the Inchnadamff Cave of Roaring and cleared up the mystery. [What mystery?]

The stream level in wet weather can sometimes be dangerous often blocking the route further into the cave. It the levels are dubious on arrival do not enter. Rising levels may not block the exit but can make crossing the stream an extreme risk as the water flow could carry unwary cavers into the flooded passages downstream.","Should not be confused with the other Uamh an Tartair at Knockan. 

The Gaelic word 'tartair' translates literally as roaring but this is also the main entrance to the Cnoc nan Uamh System.

For downstream sections see Pothole Entrance and Uamh an Uisge (aka The Waterslide). Length Given in entry for Cnoc nan Uamh.","Caves of Assynt, p. 33.

The mine was opened a few years before the First World War (it is not shown on the revision of the 2nd edition of the OS 6-inch map (Kirkcudbrightshire 1908, sheet xli), but the [poor] efficiency of the crusher resulted in the loss of the majority of the ore (Wilson and Flett, 1921).

Near Lauder, at the head of the district several specimens of copper ore were found. In the parish of Boncle, a copper mine was worked some years ago on the estate of  Lord Douglas.  

Other mentions in various newspapers but ore seems to have been poor or worthless. Various old quarries at Scare Law, Pilmuir and Trabrown Hill. 

OSA mentions some copper mines, but supposedly not sufficiently rich to defray the expense of working. 

About 12 years ago [c. 1800], a copper mine was wrought on a small farm called Hoardweel; the ore is said to have been rich, but the working was given up, owing to the vien having failed.

Canmore ID 98567 & 758179. NR58SW 5 5053 8339. Ruantallain Cave was used as a resting place for corpses which were being taken to Oronsay for burial. J Mercer 1974. [There are a number of caves in the vicinity of Ruantallain (NR 505 832). The only one named on the OS 6"" map, (1900) is 'Corpach Rudh' an t-Sailein (NR 5054 8339) described in the ONB as a ""large cave"", used for storing materials"".] Name Book (Argyll) 1878. According to Mr Mercer, Ruantallain Cave and Corpach Rubh' an t-Sailean are one and the same at NR 5053 8339. It measures 23.0m deep, 10.0m wide and up to 8.0m high. There is no evidence, i.e. crosses, to verify its use as a resting place for corpses (apart from the name); more recently the cave was utilised as a shelter for a horse, with a wall across the entrance and a byre inside. Surveyed at 1:10000. Visited by OS (NKB) 22 May 1978. Very large W-facing cave. It may have been used for storing coffins prior to their being shipped to Colonsay or Iona for burial. The cave is approached by a cart track from the nearby deserted settlement of Ruantailain. It is closed off by a high wall with two wooden gate-posts flanking a broad entrance. A low platform running across the rear of the cave is retained by drystone walling. Incorporated in it is a stone-walled animal stall with a manger. A possible circular kiln is situated in front of the cave entrance. A test pit was dug to bedrock in the northern part of the cave, 11m from the entrance wall and 6.5m from the end of the animal stall. No cultural material was found. Although it was understood to have been submerged for a time in the mid-Holocene, no evidence of this was found in the test pit. Sponsor: NMS. K Hardy 2004.

The blow-hole of Kettle Spout as it is known locally consists of a narrow arch bridging a deep chasm over the Atlantic waves. In very stormy weather fountains of water gush forth from this orifice. The approach to the blow hole should be treated with caution, the rocks are sloping and slippery, and a fall from these cliffs could prove fatal.
In the months of May and June beware also of an electric fence erected to contain livestock in the area (NF 705 727). [Mike Townsend]

The website for Kettle Cottage at Holgan Bay mentions the cottage [Taigh a' Choire (Kettle House)] takes its name from the nearby natural arch and blow hole, the ""Spouting Kettle"" or ""Slochd a Choire"" in Gaelic. Atlantic storms force huge waves into the cave causing the sea to spout into the air through the blow hole, hence the name.","Slochd na Choire - Signifies ""The Kettle pit"" and is applied to a large hole in the rock of considerable depth. It is above high water mark and the sea has access to it at high water. [addendum ""Situated in the rock north of ""Garry Gaal"".] [OS Name Book, Scotland's Places]

Tigharry or Tigh a' Ghearraidh is the house on the rock. Past the drowned village in Loch Hosta in the cliffs across the road is a spouting cave.","OS 6"" map Invernessshire Sheet XXXIII (includes: North Uist)

These appear to have been open cut workings of little interest to cavers. 3 pits at mine, other excavations, dumped material, building foundations, mill lead remains & recently renovated mill building. Pit 3 overgrown.","Mining 1st took place at Lecht in late 18th century, when York Mining Company established workings on land forfeited the government following 1745 Jacobite Rebellion. Both ironstone & manganese ore mined at site & transported to Culnakyle, near Nethybridge, for smelting. Most prominent feature of mining landscape at Lecht is 2-storeyed, rubble-built building with large arched doorway, restored & re-roofed with local slate in 1980s. Dates from second, post-1841 phase of activity at mine, & probably served as crushing mill, powered by water wheel measuring almost 8m in diameter set at one of its gable walls. Other remains include mill lade, dumps of waste material, & mine workings which consist of vertical shafts & adits driven at shallow angle into hillside. When production reached peak during 1840s, 63 people employed at mine. By 1847, however, cheap imports of manganese from Russia made it unprofitable & mine closed. Ironstone Mine (disused) [NAT]. 

Ironstone Mine, Lecht. 18th to 19th century. Principal remains tall 2-storey rubble building with segmental-arched openings; may have housed crushing machinery. High-level lade, & waterwheel about 42ins (1.06m) wide by 24ft (7.32m) diameter on one gable; kingpost roof well preserved.","aditnow.
